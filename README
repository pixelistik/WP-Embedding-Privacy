This plugin aims to improve privacy towards third parties who provide embedded media.

What it currently does:
YouTube provides a special embedding URL, youtube-nocookie.com, where they promise not to send any cookies to the viewer, unless they actively start playing the video.

The plugin changes the Wordpress auto-embedding for YouTube, so it uses this special URL.

Installation:
Like any Wordpress plugin: put the folder in the folder and activate.
