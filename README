This plugin aims to improve privacy towards third parties who provide embedded media.

What it does:
Whenever you use the Wordpress automatic embedding feature, the embed code is deactivated, so when a visitor load the page, no communication with the third party takes place. Instead, the embedded video is replaced by a locally cached thumbnail of the video.

Once the user clicks the thumbnail, the embed code is activated and the embedded video loads as usual.

Installation:
Like any Wordpress plugin: put the folder in the folder and activate.
