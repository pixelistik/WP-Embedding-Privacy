This plugin aims to improve privacy towards third parties who provide embedded media.

What it currently does:
Replaces embedded flash video player by its thumbnail. Re-inserts the embed code once the thumbnail is clicked. 

In a future version, the thumbnail will be cached locally, thus preventing a possibly undesired communication with a third party.

Installation:
Like any Wordpress plugin: put the folder in the folder and activate.
