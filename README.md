This plugin aims to improve privacy towards third parties who provide embedded media.

What it's about:
----------------
Any server can leave cookies on your browser. If any element is embedded in a website, its server can save cookies, too. If an embedding service is used on every other website out there, they could track your browsing habits. Some people consider this a privacy risk.

What it does:
-------------
Whenever you use the Wordpress automatic embedding feature, the embed code is deactivated, so when a visitor load the page, no communication with the third party takes place. Instead, the embedded video is replaced by a locally cached thumbnail of the video.

Once the user clicks the thumbnail, the embed code is activated and the embedded video loads as usual.

Installation:
-------------
Like any Wordpress plugin: put the folder in the folder and activate.
